        CLFSWM - A(nother) Common Lisp FullScreen Window Manager

 CLFSWM is a 100% Common Lisp X11 window manager (based on [1]Tinywm
 and [2]Stumpwm. Many thanks to them).
 It can be driven only with the keyboard or with the mouse.

 A display is divided in workspaces, groups and windows. Windows are
 packed together in groups.
 By default a group is fullscreen maximized (no decorations, no buttons,
 no menus: nothing, just the application fullscreen!).
 When not maximized, a group of windows can be moved, resized, tiled,
 packed or filled to others groups edges.

 For its binding, CLFSWM has two modes.
 A main mode with minimal keys and no mouse grabbing to avoid conflict
 with others applications.
 And a second mode with more keys and mouse actions.
 For details of its usage, have a look at the files keys.txt or 
 keys.html


* Installation

Boot up a common lisp implementation. I develop it with sbcl, I've
tested it with cmucl and I use it with clisp (you need the clx/xlib
package).

To use CLFSWM, load the load.lisp file. It loads the ASDF package,
build the system and start the main loop.

Another way is to do something like this:
$ cd /in/the/directory/of/clfswm/
$ clisp/cmucl/sbcl/...                  # start a lisp
  > (load "asdf.lisp")                  ; asdf for clisp or cmucl
or> (require :asdf)                     ; asdf for sbcl
  > (require :clx)                      ; clx for cmucl
  > (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :clfswm)    ; compile and load the system
  > (in-package :clfswm)                ; go in the clfswm package
  > (clfswm:main)                       ; start the main loop


* Tweaking

To change the default keybinding, have a look at the bindings*.lisp
files and at the config.lisp file for global variables.

All variables can be overwritten in a user configuration file
(/etc/clfswmrc or $HOME/.clfswmrc). It's a standard lisp file loaded at
startup. There is an example in the clfswm source (see dot-clfswmrc).

If you want to add workspaces or groups at startup, tell this to
clfswm in the init-display function in clfswm.lisp (there is already a
default workspace and a default group created).

In all cases, you can grep the source with 'CONFIG' and 'Alternative'
keywords to find where you can simply customize clfswm.



* Lisp implementation note

If you are using clisp/new-clx, be sure to use the last version (at
least 2.43). Older versions are a little bit bogus.
If you are using clisp/mit-clx or an other clx than clisp/new-clx, you
may find a speed up with the compress notify event. See the variable
*have-to-compress-notify* in the configuration file.
