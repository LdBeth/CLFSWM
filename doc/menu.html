      h: Apple2 - Simulates an original Apple ][ Plus computer in all its 1979 glory. It also reproduces the appearance of display on a color television set of the period. In "Basic Programming Mode", a simulated user types in a BASIC program and runs it. In "Text Mode", it displays the output of a program, or the contents of a file or URL. In "Slideshow Mode", it chooses random images and displays them within the limitations of the Apple ][ display hardware. (Six available colors in hi-res mode!)

      i: Atlantis - A 3D animation of a number of sharks, dolphins, and whales. Written by Mark Kilgard; 1998.
    </p>
    <p>
      j: Attraction - Uses a simple simple motion model to generate many different display modes. The control points attract each other up to a certain distance, and then begin to repel each other. The attraction/repulsion is proportional to the distance between any two particles, similar to the strong and weak nuclear forces. Written by Jamie Zawinski and John Pezaris; 1992.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      o: BlitSpin - Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.
    </p>
    <p>
      p: BlockTube - Draws a swirling, falling tunnel of reflective slabs. They fade from hue to hue. Written by Lars R. Damerow; 2003.
    </p>
    <p>
      q: Boing - This bouncing ball is a clone of the first graphics demo for the Amiga 1000, which was written by Dale Luck and RJ Mical during a break at the 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (or so the legend goes.) This looks like the original Amiga demo if you turn off "smoothing" and "lighting" and turn on "scanlines", and is somewhat more modern otherwise. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga#Boing_Ball Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2005.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      v: Braid - Draws random color-cycling inter-braided concentric circles. Written by John Neil; 1997.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: CloudLife - Generates cloud-like formations based on a variant of Conway's Life. The difference is that cells have a maximum age, after which they count as 3 for populating the next generation. This makes long-lived formations explode instead of just sitting there. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life Written by Don Marti; 2003.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Compass - This draws a compass, with all elements spinning about randomly, for that "lost and nauseous" feeling. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: DecayScreen - This takes an image and makes it melt. You've no doubt seen this effect before, but no screensaver would really be complete without it. It works best if there's something colorful visible. Warning, if the effect continues after the screen saver is off, seek medical attention. Written by David Wald, Vivek Khera, Jamie Zawinski, and Vince Levey; 1993.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Deco - Subdivides and colors rectangles randomly. It looks kind of like Brady-Bunch-era rec-room wall paneling. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian#Paris_1919.E2.80.931938 Written by Jamie Zawinski and Michael Bayne; 1997.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      |: Gears - This draws sets of turning, interlocking gears, rotating in three dimensions. See also the "Pinion" and "MoebiusGears" screen savers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute_gear http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicyclic_gearing Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2007.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLBlur - This draws a box and a few line segments, and generates a radial blur outward from it. This creates flowing field effects. This is done by rendering the scene into a small texture, then repeatedly rendering increasingly-enlarged and increasingly-transparent versions of that texture onto the frame buffer.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: Goop - This draws set of animating, transparent, amoeba-like blobs. The blobs change shape as they wander around the screen, and they are translucent, so you can see the lower blobs through the higher ones, and when one passes over another, their colors merge. I got the idea for this from a mouse pad I had once, which achieved the same kind of effect in real life by having several layers of plastic with colored oil between them. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: IMSMap - This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation. Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

      |: Interaggregate - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate.

      |: Intermomentary - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some arbitrary size. Circles are drawn with small moving points along the perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs. Glowing orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the intersection point. Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski; 2004.

      |: JigglyPuff - This does bad things with quasi-spherical objects. You have a tetrahedron with tesselated faces. The vertices on these faces have forces on them: one proportional to the distance from the surface of a sphere; and one proportional to the distance from the neighbors. They also have inertia. The resulting effect can range from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm. Somewhere in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles in a kind of disturbing manner. Written by Keith Macleod; 2003.

      |: Lavalite - Draws a 3D Simulation a Lava Lite(r). Odd-shaped blobs of a mysterious substance are heated, slowly rise to the top of the bottle, and then drop back down as they cool.

      |: LCDscrub - This screen saver is not meant to look pretty, but rather, to repair burn-in on LCD monitors. Believe it or not, screen burn is not a thing of the past. It can happen to LCD screens pretty easily, even in this modern age. However, leaving the screen on and displaying high contrast images can often repair the damage. That's what this screen saver does. See also: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum

In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he doesn't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken."
