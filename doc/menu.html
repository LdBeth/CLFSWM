    </p>
    <p>
      4: CloudLife - Generates cloud-like formations based on a variant of Conway's Life. The difference is that cells have a maximum age, after which they count as 3 for populating the next generation. This makes long-lived formations explode instead of just sitting there. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life Written by Don Marti.
    </p>
    <p>
      5: CompanionCube - The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations. The Enrichment Center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak. In the event that the Weighted Companion Cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_%28video_game%29 Written by Jamie Zawinski.

    </p>
    <p>
      B: Cubenetic - Draws a pulsating set of overlapping boxes with ever-chaning blobby patterns undulating across their surfaces. It's sort of a cubist Lavalite. Written by Jamie Zawinski.

    </p>
    <p>
      H: DecayScreen - This takes an image and makes it melt. You've no doubt seen this effect before, but no screensaver would really be complete without it. It works best if there's something colorful visible. Warning, if the effect continues after the screen saver is off, seek medical attention. Written by David Wald, Vivek Khera, Jamie Zawinski, and Vince Levey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I: Deco - Subdivides and colors rectangles randomly. It looks kind of like Brady-Bunch-era rec-room wall paneling. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian#Paris_1919.E2.80.931938 Written by Jamie Zawinski and Michael Bayne.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: FluidBalls - Models the physics of bouncing balls, or of particles in a gas or fluid, depending on the settings.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: Gears - This draws sets of turning, interlocking gears, rotating in three dimensions. See also the "Pinion" and "MoebiusGears" screen savers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute_gear http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicyclic_gearing Written by Jamie Zawinski.

    <p>
      |: GFlux - Draws a rippling waves on a rotating wireframe grid. Written by Josiah Pease.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLBlur - This draws a box and a few line segments, and generates a radial blur outward from it. This creates flowing field effects. This is done by rendering the scene into a small texture, then repeatedly rendering increasingly-enlarged and increasingly-transparent versions of that texture onto the frame buffer. As such, it's quite GPU-intensive: if you don't have a very good graphics card, it will hurt your machine bad. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLCells - Cells growing, dividing and dying on your screen. Written by Matthias Toussaint.
    </p>

      |: GLKnots - Generates some twisting 3d knot patterns. Spins 'em around. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLMatrix - Draws 3D dropping characters similar to what is seen in the title sequence of "The Matrix". See also "xmatrix" for a 2D rendering of the similar effect that appeared on the computer monitors actually *in* the movie. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLPlanet - Draws a planet bouncing around in space. The built-in image is a map of the earth (extracted from `xearth'), but you can wrap any texture around the sphere, e.g., the planetary textures that come with `ssystem'. Written by David Konerding.
    </p>

    <p>
      |: GLText - Displays a few lines of text spinning around in a solid 3D font. The text can use strftime() escape codes to display the current date and time. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Goop - This draws set of animating, transparent, amoeba-like blobs. The blobs change shape as they wander around the screen, and they are translucent, so you can see the lower blobs through the higher ones, and when one passes over another, their colors merge. I got the idea for this from a mouse pad I had once, which achieved the same kind of effect in real life by having several layers of plastic with colored oil between them. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Grav - This draws a simple orbital simulation. With trails enabled, it looks kind of like a cloud-chamber photograph. Written by Greg Bowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Greynetic - Draws random colored, stippled and transparent rectangles. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>

      |: Halo - Draws trippy psychedelic circular patterns that hurt to look at. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moire_pattern Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Helix - Spirally string-art-ish patterns. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Hilbert - This draws the recursive Hilbert space-filling curve, in both 2D and 3D variants. It incrementally animates the growth and recursion to the maximum depth, then unwinds it back. The Hilbert path is a single contiguous line that can fill a volume without crossing itself. As a data structure, Hilbert paths are useful because ordering along the curve preserves locality: points that close together along the curve are also close together in space. The converse is often, but not always, true. The coloration reflects this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Hopalong - This draws lacy fractal patterns based on iteration in the imaginary plane, from a 1986 Scientific American article. See also the "Discrete" screen saver. Written by Patrick Naughton.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Hypertorus - This shows a rotating Clifford Torus: a torus lying on the "surface" of a 4D hypersphere. Inspired by Thomas Banchoff's book "Beyond the Third Dimension: Geometry, Computer Graphics, and Higher Dimensions", Scientific American Library, 1990. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_torus http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope Written by Carsten Steger.

    <p>
      |: Hypnowheel - Draws a series of overlapping, translucent spiral patterns. The tightness of their spirals fluctuates in and out. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moire_pattern Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: IFS - This one draws spinning, colliding iterated-function-system images. Note that the "Detail" parameter is exponential. Number of points drawn is functions^detail. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system Written by Chris Le Sueur and Robby Griffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: IMSMap - This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation. Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Interaggregate - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. Though actually it doesn't look like circles at all! Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Interference - Color field based on computing decaying sinusoidal waves. Written by Hannu Mallat.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Intermomentary - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some arbitrary size. Circles are drawn with small moving points along the perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs. Glowing orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the intersection point. Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: JigglyPuff - This does bad things with quasi-spherical objects. You have a tetrahedron with tesselated faces. The vertices on these faces have forces on them: one proportional to the distance from the surface of a sphere; and one proportional to the distance from the neighbors. They also have inertia. The resulting effect can range from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm. Somewhere in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles in a kind of disturbing manner. Written by Keith Macleod.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Jigsaw - This grabs a screen image, carves it up into a jigsaw puzzle, shuffles it, and then solves the puzzle. This works especially well when you feed it an external video signal instead of letting it grab the screen image (actually, I guess this is generally true...) When it is grabbing a video image, it is sometimes pretty hard to guess what the image is going to look like once the puzzle is solved. Written by Jamie Zawinski.

    <p>
      |: Lavalite - Draws a 3D Simulation a Lava Lite(r). Odd-shaped blobs of a mysterious substance are heated, slowly rise to the top of the bottle, and then drop back down as they cool. This simulation requires a fairly fast machine (both CPU and 3D performance.)

    <p>
      |: LCDscrub - This screen saver is not meant to look pretty, but rather, to repair burn-in on LCD monitors. Believe it or not, screen burn is not a thing of the past. It can happen to LCD screens pretty easily, even in this modern age. However, leaving the screen on and displaying high contrast images can often repair the damage. That's what this screen saver does. See also: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum

      |: Lockward - A translucent spinning, blinking thing. Sort of a cross between the wards in an old combination lock and those old backlit information displays that animated and changed color via polarized light. Written by Leo L. Schwab.

      |: m6502 - This emulates a 6502 microprocessor. The family of 6502 chips were used throughout the 70's and 80's in machines such as the Atari 2600, Commodore PET, VIC20 and C64, Apple ][, and the NES. Some example programs are included, and it can also read in an assembly file as input. Original JavaScript Version by Stian Soreng: http://www.6502asm.com/. Ported to XScreenSaver by Jeremy English.

In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he doesn't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken." As reported by News of the Weird #491, 4-Jul-1997. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling Written by Timo Korvola.
