    </p>
    <p>
      o: BlitSpin - Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

      p: BlockTube - Draws a swirling, falling tunnel of reflective slabs. They fade from hue to hue. Written by Lars R. Damerow; 2003.
    </p>
    <p>
      q: Boing - This bouncing ball is a clone of the first graphics demo for the Amiga 1000, which was written by Dale Luck and RJ Mical during a break at the 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (or so the legend goes.) This looks like the original Amiga demo if you turn off "smoothing" and "lighting" and turn on "scanlines", and is somewhat more modern otherwise. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga#Boing_Ball Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
      r: Bouboule - This draws what looks like a spinning, deforming balloon with varying-sized spots painted on its invisible surface. Written by Jeremie Petit; 1997.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: CloudLife - Generates cloud-like formations based on a variant of Conway's Life. The difference is that cells have a maximum age, after which they count as 3 for populating the next generation. This makes long-lived formations explode instead of just sitting there. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life Written by Don Marti; 2003.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: DecayScreen - This takes an image and makes it melt. You've no doubt seen this effect before, but no screensaver would really be complete without it. It works best if there's something colorful visible. Warning, if the effect continues after the screen saver is off, seek medical attention. Written by David Wald, Vivek Khera, Jamie Zawinski, and Vince Levey; 1993.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Deco - Subdivides and colors rectangles randomly. It looks kind of like Brady-Bunch-era rec-room wall paneling. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian#Paris_1919.E2.80.931938 Written by Jamie Zawinski and Michael Bayne; 1997.

      |: GFlux - Draws a rippling waves on a rotating wireframe grid. Written by Josiah Pease; 2000.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLBlur - This draws a box and a few line segments, and generates a radial blur outward from it. This creates flowing field effects. This is done by rendering the scene into a small texture, then repeatedly rendering increasingly-enlarged and increasingly-transparent versions of that texture onto the frame buffer. As such, it's quite GPU-intensive: if you don't have a very good graphics card, it will hurt your machine bad. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2002.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLCells - Cells growing, dividing and dying on your screen. Written by Matthias Toussaint; 2007.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLPlanet - Draws a planet bouncing around in space. The built-in image is a map of the earth (extracted from `xearth'), but you can wrap any texture around the sphere, e.g., the planetary textures that come with `ssystem'. Written by David Konerding; 1998.

      |: GLText - Displays a few lines of text spinning around in a solid 3D font. The text can use strftime() escape codes to display the current date and time. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2001.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Goop - This draws set of animating, transparent, amoeba-like blobs. The blobs change shape as they wander around the screen, and they are translucent, so you can see the lower blobs through the higher ones, and when one passes over another, their colors merge. I got the idea for this from a mouse pad I had once, which achieved the same kind of effect in real life by having several layers of plastic with colored oil between them. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Grav - This draws a simple orbital simulation. With trails enabled, it looks kind of like a cloud-chamber photograph. Written by Greg Bowering; 1997.

    </p>
    <p>
      |: IMSMap - This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation. Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Interaggregate - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. Though actually it doesn't look like circles at all! Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski; 2004.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Interference - Color field based on computing decaying sinusoidal waves. Written by Hannu Mallat; 1998.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Intermomentary - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some arbitrary size. Circles are drawn with small moving points along the perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs. Glowing orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the intersection point. Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski; 2004.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: JigglyPuff - This does bad things with quasi-spherical objects. You have a tetrahedron with tesselated faces. The vertices on these faces have forces on them: one proportional to the distance from the surface of a sphere; and one proportional to the distance from the neighbors. They also have inertia. The resulting effect can range from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm. Somewhere in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles in a kind of disturbing manner. Written by Keith Macleod; 2003.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Jigsaw - This grabs a screen image, carves it up into a jigsaw puzzle, shuffles it, and then solves the puzzle. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.

    <p>
      |: Lavalite - Draws a 3D Simulation a Lava Lite(r). Odd-shaped blobs of a mysterious substance are heated, slowly rise to the top of the bottle, and then drop back down as they cool. This simulation requires a fairly fast machine (both CPU and 3D performance.)

    <p>
      |: LCDscrub - This screen saver is not meant to look pretty, but rather, to repair burn-in on LCD monitors. Believe it or not, screen burn is not a thing of the past. It can happen to LCD screens pretty easily, even in this modern age. However, leaving the screen on and displaying high contrast images can often repair the damage. That's what this screen saver does. See also: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum

The family of 6502 chips were used throughout the 70's and 80's in machines such as the Atari 2600, Commodore PET, VIC20 and C64, Apple ][, and the NES. Some example programs are included, and it can also read in an assembly file as input. Original JavaScript Version by Stian Soreng: http://www.6502asm.com/. Ported to XScreenSaver by Jeremy English.
