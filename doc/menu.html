      <a name="SCREENSAVER"></a><a href="#STANDARD-MENU">Screensaver</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      a: LCDscrub - This screen saver is not meant to look pretty, but rather, to repair burn-in on LCD monitors. Believe it or not, screen burn is not a thing of the past. It can happen to LCD screens pretty easily, even in this modern age. However, leaving the screen on and displaying high contrast images can often repair the damage. That's what this screen saver does. See also: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum
    </p>
    <p>
      b: Kumppa - Spiraling, spinning, and very, very fast splashes of color rush toward the screen. Written by Teemu Suutari.
    </p>
    <p>
      c: CloudLife - Generates cloud-like formations based on a variant of Conway's Life. The difference is that cells have a maximum age, after which they count as 3 for populating the next generation. This makes long-lived formations explode instead of just sitting there. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life Written by Don Marti.
    </p>
    <p>
      d: m6502 - This emulates a 6502 microprocessor. The family of 6502 chips were used throughout the 70's and 80's in machines such as the Atari 2600, Commodore PET, VIC20 and C64, Apple ][, and the NES. Some example programs are included, and it can also read in an assembly file as input. Original JavaScript Version by Stian Soreng: http://www.6502asm.com/. Ported to XScreenSaver by Jeremy English. Written by Stian Soreng and Jeremy English.
    </p>
    <p>
      e: Galaxy - This draws spinning galaxies, which then collide and scatter their stars to the, uh, four winds or something. Written by Uli Siegmund, Harald Backert, and Hubert Feyrer.
    </p>
    <p>
      f: IFS - This one draws spinning, colliding iterated-function-system images. Note that the "Detail" parameter is exponential. Number of points drawn is functions^detail. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system Written by Chris Le Sueur and Robby Griffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      g: Swirl - Flowing, swirly patterns. Written by M. Dobie and R. Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      h: StonerView - Chains of colorful squares dance around each other in complex spiral patterns. Inspired by David Tristram's `electropaint' screen saver, originally written for SGI computers in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Written by Andrew Plotkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      i: Slip - This throws some random bits on the screen, then sucks them through a jet engine and spews them out the other side. To avoid turning the image completely to mush, every now and then it will it interject some splashes of color into the scene, or go into a spin cycle, or stretch the image like taffy. Written by Scott Draves and Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      j: GFlux - Draws a rippling waves on a rotating wireframe grid. Written by Josiah Pease.
    </p>
    <p>
      k: Munch - DATAI 2 ADDB 1,2 ROTC 2,-22 XOR 1,2 JRST .-4 As reported by HAKMEM, in 1962, Jackson Wright wrote the above PDP-1 code. That code still lives on here, some 46 years later. The number of lines of enclosing code has increased substantially, however. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAKMEM http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munching_square Written by Jackson Wright and Tim Showalter.
    </p>
    <p>
      l: Apple2 - Simulates an original Apple ][ Plus computer in all its 1979 glory. It also reproduces the appearance of display on a color television set of the period. In "Basic Programming Mode", a simulated user types in a BASIC program and runs it. In "Text Mode", it displays the output of a program, or the contents of a file or URL. In "Slideshow Mode", it chooses random images and displays them within the limitations of the Apple ][ display hardware. (Six available colors in hi-res mode!) On X11 systems, This program is also a fully-functional VT100 emulator. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series Written by Trevor Blackwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      m: Hypertorus - This shows a rotating Clifford Torus: a torus lying on the "surface" of a 4D hypersphere. Inspired by Thomas Banchoff's book "Beyond the Third Dimension: Geometry, Computer Graphics, and Higher Dimensions", Scientific American Library, 1990. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_torus http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope Written by Carsten Steger.
    </p>
    <p>
      n: Jigsaw - This grabs a screen image, carves it up into a jigsaw puzzle, shuffles it, and then solves the puzzle. This works especially well when you feed it an external video signal instead of letting it grab the screen image (actually, I guess this is generally true...) When it is grabbing a video image, it is sometimes pretty hard to guess what the image is going to look like once the puzzle is solved. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      o: Rorschach - This generates random inkblot patterns via a reflected random walk. Any deep-seated neurotic tendencies which this program reveals are your own problem. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_inkblot_test http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk Written by Jamie Zawinski.

    <p>
      p: GLHanoi - Solves the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. Move N disks from one pole to another, one disk at a time, with no disk ever resting on a disk smaller than itself. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi Written by Dave Atkinson; 2005.

    <p>
      q: Circuit - Animates a number of 3D electronic components. Written by Ben Buxton.
    </p>
    <p>
      r: Starfish - This generates a sequence of undulating, throbbing, star-like patterns which pulsate, rotate, and turn inside out. Another display mode uses these shapes to lay down a field of colors, which are then cycled. The motion is very organic. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      s: Julia - Animates the Julia set (a close relative of the Mandelbrot set). The small moving dot indicates the control point from which the rest of the image was generated. See also the "Discrete" screen saver. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set Written by Sean McCullough.
    </p>
    <p>
      t: Maze - This generates random mazes (with various different algorithms), and then solves them. Backtracking and look-ahead paths are displayed in different colors. Written by Jim Randell and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      u: VidWhacker - This is a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the system's video input, and then uses some PBM filters (chosen at random) to manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge detection, subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself, etc.) Then it displays that image for a few seconds, and does it again. This works really well if you just feed broadcast television into it. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      v: Pipes - A growing plumbing system, with bolts and valves. Written by Marcelo Vianna.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      6: GLPlanet - Draws a planet bouncing around in space. The built-in image is a map of the earth (extracted from `xearth'), but you can wrap any texture around the sphere, e.g., the planetary textures that come with `ssystem'. Written by David Konerding.
    </p>
    <p>
      7: Intermomentary - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some arbitrary size. Circles are drawn with small moving points along the perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs. Glowing orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the intersection point. Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      8: Cynosure - Random dropshadowed rectangles pop onto the screen in lockstep. Written by Ozymandias G. Desiderata, Jamie Zawinski, and Stephen Linhart.
    </p>
    <p>
      9: WhirlWindWarp - Floating stars are acted upon by a mixture of simple 2D forcefields. The strength of each forcefield changes continuously, and it is also switched on and off at random. Written by Paul 'Joey' Clark.

    </p>
    <p>
      K: Hilbert - This draws the recursive Hilbert space-filling curve, in both 2D and 3D variants. It incrementally animates the growth and recursion to the maximum depth, then unwinds it back. The Hilbert path is a single contiguous line that can fill a volume without crossing itself. As a data structure, Hilbert paths are useful because ordering along the curve preserves locality: points that close together along the curve are also close together in space. The converse is often, but not always, true. The coloration reflects this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      L: Mountain - Generates random 3D plots that look vaguely mountainous. Written by Pascal Pensa.

    <p>
      N: Morph3D - Platonic solids that turn inside out and get spikey. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid Written by Marcelo Vianna.
    </p>
    <p>
      O: GLMatrix - Draws 3D dropping characters similar to what is seen in the title sequence of "The Matrix". See also "xmatrix" for a 2D rendering of the similar effect that appeared on the computer monitors actually *in* the movie. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      P: FluidBalls - Models the physics of bouncing balls, or of particles in a gas or fluid, depending on the settings. If "Shake Box" is selected, then every now and then, the box will be rotated, changing which direction is down (in order to keep the settled balls in motion.) Written by Peter Birtles and Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Qix - Bounces a series of line segments around the screen, and uses variations on this basic motion pattern to produce all sorts of different presentations: line segments, filled polygons, and overlapping translucent areas. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      R: CubicGrid - Draws the view of an observer located inside a rotating 3D lattice of colored points. Written by Vasek Potocek.
    </p>
    <p>
      S: Boing - This bouncing ball is a clone of the first graphics demo for the Amiga 1000, which was written by Dale Luck and RJ Mical during a break at the 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (or so the legend goes.) This looks like the original Amiga demo if you turn off "smoothing" and "lighting" and turn on "scanlines", and is somewhat more modern otherwise. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga#Boing_Ball Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      T: GLKnots - Generates some twisting 3d knot patterns. Spins 'em around. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory Written by Jamie Zawinski.

      |: Penrose - Draws quasiperiodic tilings; think of the implications on modern formica technology. In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he doesn't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken."

      |: CubeStorm - Draws a series of rotating 3D boxes that intersect each other and eventually fill space. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Compass - This draws a compass, with all elements spinning about randomly, for that "lost and nauseous" feeling. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Twang - Divides the screen into a grid, and plucks them. Written by Dan Bornstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: BlitSpin - Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski.

      |: XSpirograph - Simulates that pen-in-nested-plastic-gears toy from your childhood. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph Written by Rohit Singh.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: SlideScreen - This takes an image, divides it into a grid, and then randomly shuffles the squares around as if it was one of those "fifteen-puzzle" games where there is a grid of squares, one of which is missing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Piecewise - This draws a bunch of moving circles which switch from visibility to invisibility at intersection points. Written by Geoffrey Irving.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Deco - Subdivides and colors rectangles randomly. It looks kind of like Brady-Bunch-era rec-room wall paneling. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian#Paris_1919.E2.80.931938 Written by Jamie Zawinski and Michael Bayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLSnake - Draws a simulation of the Rubik's Snake puzzle. See also the "Rubik" and "Cube21" screen savers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Snake Written by Jamie Wilkinson, Andrew Bennetts, and Peter Aylett.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: RDbomb - Draws a grid of growing square-like shapes that, once they overtake each other, react in unpredictable ways. "RD" stands for reaction-diffusion. Written by Scott Draves.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: FuzzyFlakes - Falling colored snowflake/flower shapes. Written by Barry Dmytro.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Braid - Draws random color-cycling inter-braided concentric circles. Written by John Neil.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: MetaBalls - Draws two dimensional metaballs: overlapping and merging balls with fuzzy edges. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs Written by W.P. van Paassen.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: DangerBall - Draws a ball that periodically extrudes many random spikes. Ouch! Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Molecule - Draws several different representations of molecules. Some common molecules are built in, and it can also read PDB (Protein Data Bank) files as input. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_%28file_format%29 Written by Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: BlinkBox - Shows a ball contained inside of a bounding box. Colored blocks blink in when the ball hits the sides. Written by Jeremy English.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Sonar - This draws a sonar screen that pings (get it?) the hosts on your local network, and plots their distance (response time) from you. The three rings represent ping times of approximately 2.5, 70 and 2,000 milliseconds respectively. Alternately, it can run a simulation that doesn't involve hosts. (If pinging doesn't work, you may need to make the executable be setuid.) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping#History Written by Stephen Martin and Jamie Zawinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: GLCells - Cells growing, dividing and dying on your screen. Written by Matthias Toussaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Squiral - Draws a set of interacting, square-spiral-producing automata. The spirals grow outward until they hit something, then they go around it. Written by Jeff Epler.
    </p>
    <p>
      |: Klein - This draws a visualization of a Klein bottle or some other interesting parametric surfaces. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle Written by Andrey Mirtchovski.
