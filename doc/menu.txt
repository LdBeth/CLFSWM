Screensaver
a: LCDscrub - This screen saver is not meant to look pretty, but rather, to repair burn-in on LCD monitors. Believe it or not, screen burn is not a thing of the past. It can happen to LCD screens pretty easily, even in this modern age. However, leaving the screen on and displaying high contrast images can often repair the damage. That's what this screen saver does. See also: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum
b: Kumppa - Spiraling, spinning, and very, very fast splashes of color rush toward the screen. Written by Teemu Suutari.
c: CloudLife - Generates cloud-like formations based on a variant of Conway's Life. The difference is that cells have a maximum age, after which they count as 3 for populating the next generation. This makes long-lived formations explode instead of just sitting there. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life Written by Don Marti.
d: m6502 - This emulates a 6502 microprocessor. The family of 6502 chips were used throughout the 70's and 80's in machines such as the Atari 2600, Commodore PET, VIC20 and C64, Apple ][, and the NES. Some example programs are included, and it can also read in an assembly file as input. Original JavaScript Version by Stian Soreng: http://www.6502asm.com/. Ported to XScreenSaver by Jeremy English. Written by Stian Soreng and Jeremy English.
e: Galaxy - This draws spinning galaxies, which then collide and scatter their stars to the, uh, four winds or something. Written by Uli Siegmund, Harald Backert, and Hubert Feyrer.
f: IFS - This one draws spinning, colliding iterated-function-system images. Note that the "Detail" parameter is exponential. Number of points drawn is functions^detail. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system Written by Chris Le Sueur and Robby Griffin.
g: Swirl - Flowing, swirly patterns. Written by M. Dobie and R. Taylor.
h: StonerView - Chains of colorful squares dance around each other in complex spiral patterns. Inspired by David Tristram's `electropaint' screen saver, originally written for SGI computers in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Written by Andrew Plotkin.
i: Slip - This throws some random bits on the screen, then sucks them through a jet engine and spews them out the other side. To avoid turning the image completely to mush, every now and then it will it interject some splashes of color into the scene, or go into a spin cycle, or stretch the image like taffy. Written by Scott Draves and Jamie Zawinski.
j: GFlux - Draws a rippling waves on a rotating wireframe grid. Written by Josiah Pease.
k: Munch - DATAI 2 ADDB 1,2 ROTC 2,-22 XOR 1,2 JRST .-4 As reported by HAKMEM, in 1962, Jackson Wright wrote the above PDP-1 code. That code still lives on here, some 46 years later. The number of lines of enclosing code has increased substantially, however. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAKMEM http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munching_square Written by Jackson Wright and Tim Showalter.
l: Apple2 - Simulates an original Apple ][ Plus computer in all its 1979 glory. It also reproduces the appearance of display on a color television set of the period. In "Basic Programming Mode", a simulated user types in a BASIC program and runs it. In "Text Mode", it displays the output of a program, or the contents of a file or URL. In "Slideshow Mode", it chooses random images and displays them within the limitations of the Apple ][ display hardware. (Six available colors in hi-res mode!) On X11 systems, This program is also a fully-functional VT100 emulator. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series Written by Trevor Blackwell.
m: Hypertorus - This shows a rotating Clifford Torus: a torus lying on the "surface" of a 4D hypersphere. Inspired by Thomas Banchoff's book "Beyond the Third Dimension: Geometry, Computer Graphics, and Higher Dimensions", Scientific American Library, 1990. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_torus http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope Written by Carsten Steger.
n: Jigsaw - This grabs a screen image, carves it up into a jigsaw puzzle, shuffles it, and then solves the puzzle. This works especially well when you feed it an external video signal instead of letting it grab the screen image (actually, I guess this is generally true...) When it is grabbing a video image, it is sometimes pretty hard to guess what the image is going to look like once the puzzle is solved. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
o: Rorschach - This generates random inkblot patterns via a reflected random walk. Any deep-seated neurotic tendencies which this program reveals are your own problem. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_inkblot_test http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk Written by Jamie Zawinski.
p: GLHanoi - Solves the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. Move N disks from one pole to another, one disk at a time, with no disk ever resting on a disk smaller than itself. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi Written by Dave Atkinson; 2005. 	
q: Circuit - Animates a number of 3D electronic components. Written by Ben Buxton.
r: Starfish - This generates a sequence of undulating, throbbing, star-like patterns which pulsate, rotate, and turn inside out. Another display mode uses these shapes to lay down a field of colors, which are then cycled. The motion is very organic. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
s: Julia - Animates the Julia set (a close relative of the Mandelbrot set). The small moving dot indicates the control point from which the rest of the image was generated. See also the "Discrete" screen saver. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set Written by Sean McCullough.
t: Maze - This generates random mazes (with various different algorithms), and then solves them. Backtracking and look-ahead paths are displayed in different colors. Written by Jim Randell and many others.
u: VidWhacker - This is a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the system's video input, and then uses some PBM filters (chosen at random) to manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge detection, subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself, etc.) Then it displays that image for a few seconds, and does it again. This works really well if you just feed broadcast television into it. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
v: Pipes - A growing plumbing system, with bolts and valves. Written by Marcelo Vianna.
w: SBalls - Draws an animation of textured balls spinning like crazy. Written by Eric Lassauge.
x: MirrorBlob - Draws a wobbly blob that distorts the image behind it. Written by Jon Dowdall.

3: Spotlight - Draws a spotlight scanning across a black screen, illuminating the underlying desktop (or a picture) when it passes. Written by Rick Schultz and Jamie Zawinski.
4: SkyTentacles - There is a tentacled abomination in the sky. From above you it devours. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
5: Surfaces - This draws a visualization of several interesting parametric surfaces. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DinisSurface.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneper_surface http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EnnepersMinimalSurface.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KuenSurface.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moebius_strip http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Seashell.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SwallowtailCatastrophe.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BohemianDome.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_umbrella http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PlueckersConoid.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HennebergsMinimalSurface.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CatalansSurface.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CorkscrewSurface.html Written by Andrey Mirtchovski and Carsten Steger.
6: GLPlanet - Draws a planet bouncing around in space. The built-in image is a map of the earth (extracted from `xearth'), but you can wrap any texture around the sphere, e.g., the planetary textures that come with `ssystem'. Written by David Konerding.
7: Intermomentary - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some arbitrary size. Circles are drawn with small moving points along the perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs. Glowing orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the intersection point. Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski.
8: Cynosure - Random dropshadowed rectangles pop onto the screen in lockstep. Written by Ozymandias G. Desiderata, Jamie Zawinski, and Stephen Linhart.
9: WhirlWindWarp - Floating stars are acted upon by a mixture of simple 2D forcefields. The strength of each forcefield changes continuously, and it is also switched on and off at random. Written by Paul 'Joey' Clark.
A: SpeedMine - Simulates speeding down a rocky mineshaft, or a funky dancing worm. Written by Conrad Parker.
B: Flow - Strange attractors formed of flows in a 3D differential equation phase space. Features the popular attractors described by Lorentz, Roessler, Birkhoff and Duffing, and can discover entirely new attractors by itself. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor Written by Tim Auckland.
C: Bouboule - This draws what looks like a spinning, deforming balloon with varying-sized spots painted on its invisible surface. Written by Jeremie Petit.
D: Barcode - Draws a random sequence of colorful barcodes scrolling across your screen. CONSUME! The barcodes follow the UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8 or EAN-13 standards. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Article_Number Written by Dan Bornstein.
E: Moire2 - Generates fields of concentric circles or ovals, and combines the planes with various operations. The planes are moving independently of one another, causing the interference lines to spray. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moire_pattern Written by Jamie Zawinski.
F: BouncingCow - A Cow. A Trampoline. Together, they fight crime. Written by Jamie Zawinski.

K: Hilbert - This draws the recursive Hilbert space-filling curve, in both 2D and 3D variants. It incrementally animates the growth and recursion to the maximum depth, then unwinds it back. The Hilbert path is a single contiguous line that can fill a volume without crossing itself. As a data structure, Hilbert paths are useful because ordering along the curve preserves locality: points that close together along the curve are also close together in space. The converse is often, but not always, true. The coloration reflects this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve Written by Jamie Zawinski.
L: Mountain - Generates random 3D plots that look vaguely mountainous. Written by Pascal Pensa.
M: Polytopes - This shows one of the six regular 4D polytopes rotating in 4D. Inspired by H.S.M Coxeter's book "Regular Polytopes", 3rd Edition, Dover Publications, Inc., 1973, and Thomas Banchoff's book "Beyond the Third Dimension: Geometry, Computer Graphics, and Higher Dimensions", Scientific American Library, 1990. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope Written by Carsten Steger.
N: Morph3D - Platonic solids that turn inside out and get spikey. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid Written by Marcelo Vianna.
O: GLMatrix - Draws 3D dropping characters similar to what is seen in the title sequence of "The Matrix". See also "xmatrix" for a 2D rendering of the similar effect that appeared on the computer monitors actually *in* the movie. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
P: FluidBalls - Models the physics of bouncing balls, or of particles in a gas or fluid, depending on the settings. If "Shake Box" is selected, then every now and then, the box will be rotated, changing which direction is down (in order to keep the settled balls in motion.) Written by Peter Birtles and Jamie Zawinski.
Q: Qix - Bounces a series of line segments around the screen, and uses variations on this basic motion pattern to produce all sorts of different presentations: line segments, filled polygons, and overlapping translucent areas. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix Written by Jamie Zawinski.
R: CubicGrid - Draws the view of an observer located inside a rotating 3D lattice of colored points. Written by Vasek Potocek.
S: Boing - This bouncing ball is a clone of the first graphics demo for the Amiga 1000, which was written by Dale Luck and RJ Mical during a break at the 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (or so the legend goes.) This looks like the original Amiga demo if you turn off "smoothing" and "lighting" and turn on "scanlines", and is somewhat more modern otherwise. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga#Boing_Ball Written by Jamie Zawinski.
T: GLKnots - Generates some twisting 3d knot patterns. Spins 'em around. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory Written by Jamie Zawinski.

V: BSOD - BSOD stands for "Blue Screen of Death". The finest in personal computer emulation, BSOD simulates popular screen savers from a number of less robust operating systems. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
W: Celtic - Repeatedly draws random Celtic cross-stitch patterns. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_knot Written by Max Froumentin.
X: TimeTunnel - Draws an animation similar to the opening and closing effects on the Dr. Who TV show. Written by Sean P. Brennan.
Y: Rocks - This draws an animation of flight through an asteroid field, with changes in rotation and direction. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
Z: Kaleidescope - A simple kaleidoscope. See also "GLeidescope". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope Written by Ron Tapia.
|: Deluxe - Draws a pulsing sequence of transparent stars, circles, and lines. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Pinion - Draws an interconnected set of gears moving across the screen. See also the "Gears" and "MoebiusGears" screen savers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute_gear Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Hopalong - This draws lacy fractal patterns based on iteration in the imaginary plane, from a 1986 Scientific American article. See also the "Discrete" screen saver. Written by Patrick Naughton.
|: Atlantis - A 3D animation of a number of sharks, dolphins, and whales. Written by Mark Kilgard.
|: Goop - This draws set of animating, transparent, amoeba-like blobs. The blobs change shape as they wander around the screen, and they are translucent, so you can see the lower blobs through the higher ones, and when one passes over another, their colors merge. I got the idea for this from a mouse pad I had once, which achieved the same kind of effect in real life by having several layers of plastic with colored oil between them. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Noof - Draws some rotatey patterns, using OpenGL. Written by Bill Torzewski.
|: Pong - This simulates the 1971 Pong home video game, as well as various artifacts from displaying it on a color TV set. In clock mode, the score keeps track of the current time. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong Written by Jeremy English and Trevor Blackwell.
|: Interaggregate - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. Though actually it doesn't look like circles at all! Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski.
|: Petri - This simulates colonies of mold growing in a petri dish. Growing colored circles overlap and leave spiral interference in their wake. Written by Dan Bornstein.

|: Wormhole - Flying through a colored wormhole in space. Written by Jon Rafkind.
|: Spheremonics - These closed objects are commonly called spherical harmonics, although they are only remotely related to the mathematical definition found in the solution to certain wave functions, most notably the eigenfunctions of angular momentum operators. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics#Visualization_of_the_spherical_harmonics Written by Paul Bourke and Jamie Zawinski.
|: Substrate - Crystalline lines grow on a computational substrate. A simple perpendicular growth rule creates intricate city-like structures. Written by J. Tarbell and Mike Kershaw.

|: DecayScreen - This takes an image and makes it melt. You've no doubt seen this effect before, but no screensaver would really be complete without it. It works best if there's something colorful visible. Warning, if the effect continues after the screen saver is off, seek medical attention. Written by David Wald, Vivek Khera, Jamie Zawinski, and Vince Levey.
|: Tangram - Solves tangram puzzles. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram Written by Jeremy English.
|: Lavalite - Draws a 3D Simulation a Lava Lite(r). Odd-shaped blobs of a mysterious substance are heated, slowly rise to the top of the bottle, and then drop back down as they cool. This simulation requires a fairly fast machine (both CPU and 3D performance.) "LAVA LITE(r) and the configuration of the LAVA(r) brand motion lamp are registered trademarks of Haggerty Enterprises, Inc. The configuration of the globe and base of the motion lamp are registered trademarks of Haggerty Enterprises, Inc. in the U.S.A. and in other countries around the world." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_lamp http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs Written by Jamie Zawinski.

|: Bubble3D - Draws a stream of rising, undulating 3D bubbles, rising toward the top of the screen, with transparency and specular reflections. Written by Richard Jones.
|: CompanionCube - The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations. The Enrichment Center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak. In the event that the Weighted Companion Cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_%28video_game%29 Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Juggler3D - 3D simulation of a juggler performing with balls, clubs and rings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap Written by Brian Apps.

|: JigglyPuff - This does bad things with quasi-spherical objects. You have a tetrahedron with tesselated faces. The vertices on these faces have forces on them: one proportional to the distance from the surface of a sphere; and one proportional to the distance from the neighbors. They also have inertia. The resulting effect can range from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm. Somewhere in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles in a kind of disturbing manner. Written by Keith Macleod.
|: Wander - Draws a colorful random-walk, in various forms. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk Written by Rick Campbell.
|: Cube21 - Animates a Rubik-like puzzle known as Cube 21 or Square-1. The rotations are chosen randomly. See also the "Rubik" and "GLSnake" screen savers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_One_%28puzzle%29 Written by Vasek Potocek.
|: FlipText - Draws successive pages of text. The lines flip in and out in a soothing 3D pattern. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Providence - "A pyramid unfinished. In the zenith an eye in a triangle, surrounded by a glory, proper." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence Written by Blair Tennessy.
|: Penrose - Draws quasiperiodic tilings; think of the implications on modern formica technology. In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he doesn't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken." As reported by News of the Weird #491, 4-Jul-1997. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling Written by Timo Korvola.
|: FadePlot - Draws what looks like a waving ribbon following a sinusoidal path. Written by Bas van Gaalen and Charles Vidal.
|: XFlame - Draws a simulation of pulsing fire. It can also take an arbitrary image and set it on fire too. Written by Carsten Haitzler and many others.
|: Photopile - Loads several random images, and displays them as if lying in a random pile. The pile is periodically reshuffled, with new images coming in and old ones being thrown out. Written by Jens Kilian.
|: GLBlur - This draws a box and a few line segments, and generates a radial blur outward from it. This creates flowing field effects. This is done by rendering the scene into a small texture, then repeatedly rendering increasingly-enlarged and increasingly-transparent versions of that texture onto the frame buffer. As such, it's quite GPU-intensive: if you don't have a very good graphics card, it will hurt your machine bad. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Crystal - Moving polygons, similar to a kaleidoscope. See also the "Kaleidescope" and "GLeidescope" screen savers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope Written by Jouk Jansen.
|: Interference - Color field based on computing decaying sinusoidal waves. Written by Hannu Mallat.
|: Carousel - Loads several random images, and displays them flying in a circular formation. The formation changes speed and direction randomly, and images periodically drop out to be replaced by new ones. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Epicycle - This draws the path traced out by a point on the edge of a circle. That circle rotates around a point on the rim of another circle, and so on, several times. These were the basis for the pre-heliocentric model of planetary motion. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle Written by James Youngman.
|: StarWars - Draws a stream of text slowly scrolling into the distance at an angle, over a star field, like at the beginning of the movie of the same name. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_opening_crawl Written by Jamie Zawinski and Claudio Matauoka.
|: Vermiculate - Draws squiggly worm-like paths. Written by Tyler Pierce.
|: Blaster - Draws a simulation of flying space-combat robots (cleverly disguised as colored circles) doing battle in front of a moving star field. Written by Jonathan Lin.
|: Discrete - More "discrete map" systems, including new variants of Hopalong and Julia, and a few others. Written by Tim Auckland.

|: Demon - A cellular automaton that starts with a random field, and organizes it into stripes and spirals. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon Written by David Bagley.
|: TronBit - Draws an animation of the character "Bit" from the film, "Tron". The "yes" state is a tetrahedron; the "no" state is the second stellation of an icosahedron; and the idle state oscillates between a small triambic icosahedron and the compound of an icosahedron and a dodecahedron. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tron_characters#Bit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_polyhedra http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellation Written by Jamie Zawinski.

|: BlockTube - Draws a swirling, falling tunnel of reflective slabs. They fade from hue to hue. Written by Lars R. Damerow.
|: Moire - When the lines on the screen Make more lines in between, That's a moire'! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moire_pattern Written by Jamie Zawinski and Michael Bayne.
|: Drift - Drifting recursive fractal cosmic flames. Written by Scott Draves.
|: NoseGuy - A little man with a big nose wanders around your screen saying things. Written by Dan Heller and Jamie Zawinski.
|: FlipScreen3D - Grabs an image of the desktop, turns it into a GL texture map, and spins it around and deforms it in various ways. Written by Ben Buxton and Jamie Zawinski.
|: Strange - This draws iterations to strange attractors: it's a colorful, unpredictably-animating swarm of dots that swoops and twists around. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor Written by Massimino Pascal.
|: CWaves - This generates a languidly-scrolling vertical field of sinusoidal colors. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: IMSMap - This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation. Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski.
|: GLSlideshow - Loads a random sequence of images and smoothly scans and zooms around in each, fading from pan to pan. Written by Jamie Zawinski and Mike Oliphant.
|: ShadeBobs - This draws smoothly-shaded oscillating oval patterns that look something like vapor trails or neon tubes. Written by Shane Smit.

|: Halo - Draws trippy psychedelic circular patterns that hurt to look at. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moire_pattern Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: XRaySwarm - Draws a few swarms of critters flying around the screen, with faded color trails behind them. Written by Chris Leger.
|: Anemotaxis - Anemotaxis demonstrates a search algorithm designed for locating a source of odor in turbulent atmosphere. The searcher is able to sense the odor and determine local instantaneous wind direction. The goal is to find the source in the shortest mean time. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemotaxis Written by Eugene Balkovsky.
|: Queens - Solves the N-Queens problem (where N is between 5 and 10 queens). The problem is: how may one place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no queen can attack a sister? See also the "Endgame" screen saver. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle Written by Blair Tennessy.
|: Halftone - Draws the gravity force in each point on the screen seen through a halftone dot pattern. The gravity force is calculated from a set of moving mass points. View it from a distance for best effect. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone Written by Peter Jaric.

|: Pacman - Simulates a game of Pac-Man on a randomly-created level. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man Written by Edwin de Jong.
|: Voronoi - Draws a randomly-colored Voronoi tessellation, and periodically zooms in and adds new points. The existing points also wander around. There are a set of control points on the plane, each at the center of a colored cell. Every pixel within that cell is closer to that cell's control point than to any other control point. That is what determines the cell's shapes. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: BoxFit - Packs the screen with growing squares or circles, colored according to a horizontal or vertical gradient, or according to the colors of the desktop or a loaded image file. The objects grow until they touch, then stop. When the screen is full, they shrink away and the process restarts. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Coral - Simulates coral growth, albeit somewhat slowly. Written by Frederick Roeber.
|: TopBlock - Creates a 3D world with dropping blocks that build up and up. Written by rednuht.
|: Lament - Animates a simulation of Lemarchand's Box, the Lament Configuration, repeatedly solving itself. Warning: occasionally opens doors. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemarchand%27s_box Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Attraction - Uses a simple simple motion model to generate many different display modes. The control points attract each other up to a certain distance, and then begin to repel each other. The attraction/repulsion is proportional to the distance between any two particles, similar to the strong and weak nuclear forces. Written by Jamie Zawinski and John Pezaris.
|: Gleidescope - A kaleidoscope that operates on your desktop image, or on image files loaded from disk. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope Written by Andrew Dean.
|: CubeStorm - Draws a series of rotating 3D boxes that intersect each other and eventually fill space. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Compass - This draws a compass, with all elements spinning about randomly, for that "lost and nauseous" feeling. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Twang - Divides the screen into a grid, and plucks them. Written by Dan Bornstein.
|: BlitSpin - Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: XSpirograph - Simulates that pen-in-nested-plastic-gears toy from your childhood. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph Written by Rohit Singh.
|: SlideScreen - This takes an image, divides it into a grid, and then randomly shuffles the squares around as if it was one of those "fifteen-puzzle" games where there is a grid of squares, one of which is missing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Piecewise - This draws a bunch of moving circles which switch from visibility to invisibility at intersection points. Written by Geoffrey Irving.
|: Deco - Subdivides and colors rectangles randomly. It looks kind of like Brady-Bunch-era rec-room wall paneling. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian#Paris_1919.E2.80.931938 Written by Jamie Zawinski and Michael Bayne.
|: GLSnake - Draws a simulation of the Rubik's Snake puzzle. See also the "Rubik" and "Cube21" screen savers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Snake Written by Jamie Wilkinson, Andrew Bennetts, and Peter Aylett.

|: FuzzyFlakes - Falling colored snowflake/flower shapes. Written by Barry Dmytro.
|: Braid - Draws random color-cycling inter-braided concentric circles. Written by John Neil.
|: MetaBalls - Draws two dimensional metaballs: overlapping and merging balls with fuzzy edges. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs Written by W.P. van Paassen.
|: DangerBall - Draws a ball that periodically extrudes many random spikes. Ouch! Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: Molecule - Draws several different representations of molecules. Some common molecules are built in, and it can also read PDB (Protein Data Bank) files as input. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_%28file_format%29 Written by Jamie Zawinski.
|: BlinkBox - Shows a ball contained inside of a bounding box. Colored blocks blink in when the ball hits the sides. Written by Jeremy English.
|: Sonar - This draws a sonar screen that pings (get it?) the hosts on your local network, and plots their distance (response time) from you. The three rings represent ping times of approximately 2.5, 70 and 2,000 milliseconds respectively. Alternately, it can run a simulation that doesn't involve hosts. (If pinging doesn't work, you may need to make the executable be setuid.) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping#History Written by Stephen Martin and Jamie Zawinski.
|: GLCells - Cells growing, dividing and dying on your screen. Written by Matthias Toussaint.
|: Squiral - Draws a set of interacting, square-spiral-producing automata. The spirals grow outward until they hit something, then they go around it. Written by Jeff Epler.
|: Klein - This draws a visualization of a Klein bottle or some other interesting parametric surfaces. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle Written by Andrey Mirtchovski.
