In "Slideshow Mode", it chooses random images and displays them within the limitations of the Apple ][ display hardware. (Six available colors in hi-res mode!) On X11 systems, This program is also a fully-functional VT100 emulator. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series Written by Trevor Blackwell; 2003.
i: Atlantis - A 3D animation of a number of sharks, dolphins, and whales. Written by Mark Kilgard; 1998.

Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.
p: BlockTube - Draws a swirling, falling tunnel of reflective slabs. They fade from hue to hue. Written by Lars R. Damerow; 2003.
q: Boing - This bouncing ball is a clone of the first graphics demo for the Amiga 1000, which was written by Dale Luck and RJ Mical during a break at the 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (or so the legend goes.) This looks like the original Amiga demo if you turn off "smoothing" and "lighting" and turn on "scanlines", and is somewhat more modern otherwise. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga#Boing_Ball Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2005.

|: Goop - This draws set of animating, transparent, amoeba-like blobs. The blobs change shape as they wander around the screen, and they are translucent, so you can see the lower blobs through the higher ones, and when one passes over another, their colors merge. I got the idea for this from a mouse pad I had once, which achieved the same kind of effect in real life by having several layers of plastic with colored oil between them. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.
|: Grav - This draws a simple orbital simulation. With trails enabled, it looks kind of like a cloud-chamber photograph. Written by Greg Bowering; 1997.

|: IMSMap - This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation. Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.
|: Interaggregate - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. Though actually it doesn't look like circles at all! Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski; 2004.
|: Interference - Color field based on computing decaying sinusoidal waves. Written by Hannu Mallat; 1998.
|: Intermomentary - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some arbitrary size. Circles are drawn with small moving points along the perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs. Glowing orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the intersection point. Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski; 2004.
|: JigglyPuff - This does bad things with quasi-spherical objects. You have a tetrahedron with tesselated faces. The vertices on these faces have forces on them: one proportional to the distance from the surface of a sphere; and one proportional to the distance from the neighbors. They also have inertia. The resulting effect can range from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm. Somewhere in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles in a kind of disturbing manner. Written by Keith Macleod; 2003.

The configuration of the globe and base of the motion lamp are registered trademarks of Haggerty Enterprises, Inc. in the U.S.A. and in other countries around the world." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_lamp http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2002.
|: LCDscrub - This screen saver is not meant to look pretty, but rather, to repair burn-in on LCD monitors. Believe it or not, screen burn is not a thing of the past. It can happen to LCD screens pretty easily, even in this modern age. However, leaving the screen on and displaying high contrast images can often repair the damage. That's what this screen saver does. See also: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum

(If pinging doesn't work, you may need to make the executable be setuid.) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping#History Written by Jamie Zawinski and Stephen Martin; 1998.
|: SpeedMine - Simulates speeding down a rocky mineshaft, or a funky dancing worm. Written by Conrad Parker; 2001.
|: Spheremonics - These closed objects are commonly called spherical harmonics, although they are only remotely related to the mathematical definition found in the solution to certain wave functions, most notably the eigenfunctions of angular momentum operators. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics#Visualization_of_the_spherical_harmonics Written by Paul Bourke and Jamie Zawinski; 2002.

|: Squiral - Draws a set of interacting, square-spiral-producing automata. The spirals grow outward until they hit something, then they go around it. Written by Jeff Epler; 1999.
|: Stairs - Escher's infinite staircase. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurits_Cornelis_Escher Written by Marcelo Vianna; 1998.
|: Starfish - This generates a sequence of undulating, throbbing, star-like patterns which pulsate, rotate, and turn inside out. Another display mode uses these shapes to lay down a field of colors, which are then cycled. The motion is very organic. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.
|: StarWars - Draws a stream of text slowly scrolling into the distance at an angle, over a star field, like at the beginning of the movie of the same name. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_opening_crawl Written by Jamie Zawinski and Claudio Matauoka; 2001.
|: StonerView - Chains of colorful squares dance around each other in complex spiral patterns. Inspired by David Tristram's `electropaint' screen saver, originally written for SGI computers in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Written by Andrew Plotkin; 2001.
|: Strange - This draws iterations to strange attractors: it's a colorful, unpredictably-animating swarm of dots that swoops and twists around. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor Written by Massimino Pascal; 1997.
|: Substrate - Crystalline lines grow on a computational substrate. A simple perpendicular growth rule creates intricate city-like structures. Written by J. Tarbell and Mike Kershaw; 2004.
|: Superquadrics - Morphing 3D shapes. Written by Ed Mackey; 1987, 1997.
|: Surfaces - This draws a visualization of several interesting parametric surfaces. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DinisSurface.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneper_surface http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EnnepersMinimalSurface.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KuenSurface.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moebius_strip http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Seashell.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SwallowtailCatastrophe.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BohemianDome.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_umbrella http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PlueckersConoid.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HennebergsMinimalSurface.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CatalansSurface.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CorkscrewSurface.html Written by Andrey Mirtchovski and Carsten Steger; 2003.

|: Vermiculate - Draws squiggly worm-like paths. Written by Tyler Pierce; 2001.
|: VidWhacker - This is a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the system's video input, and then uses some PBM filters (chosen at random) to manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge detection, subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself, etc.) Then it displays that image for a few seconds, and does it again. This works really well if you just feed broadcast television into it. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1998.
|: Voronoi - Draws a randomly-colored Voronoi tessellation, and periodically zooms in and adds new points. The existing points also wander around. There are a set of control points on the plane, each at the center of a colored cell. Every pixel within that cell is closer to that cell's control point than to any other control point. That is what determines the cell's shapes. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2007.
|: Wander - Draws a colorful random-walk, in various forms. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk Written by Rick Campbell; 1999.
|: WebCollage - This makes collages out of random images pulled off of the World Wide Web. It finds these images by doing random web searches, and then extracting images from the returned pages. WARNING: THE INTERNET SOMETIMES CONTAINS PORNOGRAPHY. The Internet being what it is, absolutely anything might show up in the collage including -- quite possibly -- pornography, or even nudity. Please act accordingly. See also http://www.jwz.org/webcollage/ Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.
|: WhirlWindWarp - Floating stars are acted upon by a mixture of simple 2D forcefields. The strength of each forcefield changes continuously, and it is also switched on and off at random. Written by Paul 'Joey' Clark; 2001.
|: Wormhole - Flying through a colored wormhole in space. Written by Jon Rafkind; 2004.
|: XAnalogTV - XAnalogTV shows a detailed simulation of an old TV set showing various test patterns, with various picture artifacts like snow, bloom, distortion, ghosting, and hash noise. It also simulates the TV warming up. It will cycle through 12 channels, some with images you give it, and some with color bars or nothing but static. Written by Trevor Blackwell; 2003.
|: XFlame - Draws a simulation of pulsing fire. It can also take an arbitrary image and set it on fire too. Written by Carsten Haitzler and many others; 1999.
|: XJack - This behaves schizophrenically and makes a lot of typos. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.
|: XLyap - This generates pretty fractal pictures via the Lyapunov exponent. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent Written by Ron Record; 1997.
|: XMatrix - Draws dropping characters similar to what is seen on the computer monitors in "The Matrix". See also "GLMatrix" for a 3D rendering of the similar effect that appeared in the movie's title sequence. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.
|: XRaySwarm - Draws a few swarms of critters flying around the screen, with faded color trails behind them. Written by Chris Leger; 2000.
|: XSpirograph - Simulates that pen-in-nested-plastic-gears toy from your childhood. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph Written by Rohit Singh; 2000.
|: Zoom - Zooms in on a part of the screen and then moves around. With the "Lenses" option, the result is like looking through many overlapping lenses rather than just a simple zoom. Written by James Macnicol; 2001.
