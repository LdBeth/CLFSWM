g: Apollonian - Draws an Apollonian gasket: a fractal packing of circles with smaller circles, demonstrating Descartes's theorem. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_theorem Written by Allan R. Wilks and David Bagley; 2002.
h: Apple2 - Simulates an original Apple ][ Plus computer in all its 1979 glory. It also reproduces the appearance of display on a color television set of the period. In "Basic Programming Mode", a simulated user types in a BASIC program and runs it. In "Text Mode", it displays the output of a program, or the contents of a file or URL. In "Slideshow Mode", it chooses random images and displays them within the limitations of the Apple ][ display hardware. (Six available colors in hi-res mode!) On X11 systems, This program is also a fully-functional VT100 emulator. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series Written by Trevor Blackwell; 2003.
i: Atlantis - A 3D animation of a number of sharks, dolphins, and whales. Written by Mark Kilgard; 1998.
j: Attraction - Uses a simple simple motion model to generate many different display modes. The control points attract each other up to a certain distance, and then begin to repel each other. The attraction/repulsion is proportional to the distance between any two particles, similar to the strong and weak nuclear forces. Written by Jamie Zawinski and John Pezaris; 1992.
k: Atunnel - Draws an animation of a textured tunnel in GL. Written by Eric Lassauge and Roman Podobedov; 2003.

n: BlinkBox - Shows a ball contained inside of a bounding box. Colored blocks blink in when the ball hits the sides. Written by Jeremy English; 2003.
o: BlitSpin - Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.
p: BlockTube - Draws a swirling, falling tunnel of reflective slabs. They fade from hue to hue. Written by Lars R. Damerow; 2003.
q: Boing - This bouncing ball is a clone of the first graphics demo for the Amiga 1000, which was written by Dale Luck and RJ Mical during a break at the 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (or so the legend goes.) This looks like the original Amiga demo if you turn off "smoothing" and "lighting" and turn on "scanlines", and is somewhat more modern otherwise. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga#Boing_Ball Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2005.
r: Bouboule - This draws what looks like a spinning, deforming balloon with varying-sized spots painted on its invisible surface. Written by Jeremie Petit; 1997.

v: Braid - Draws random color-cycling inter-braided concentric circles. Written by John Neil; 1997.
w: BSOD - BSOD stands for "Blue Screen of Death". The finest in personal computer emulation, BSOD simulates popular screen savers from a number of less robust operating systems. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1998.
x: Bubble3D - Draws a stream of rising, undulating 3D bubbles, rising toward the top of the screen, with transparency and specular reflections. Written by Richard Jones; 1998.
y: Bumps - A spotlight roams across an embossed version of your desktop or other picture. Written by Shane Smit; 1999.
z: Cage - This draws Escher's "Impossible Cage", a 3d analog of a moebius strip, and rotates it in three dimensions. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurits_Cornelis_Escher Written by Marcelo Vianna; 1998.
|: Carousel - Loads several random images, and displays them flying in a circular formation. The formation changes speed and direction randomly, and images periodically drop out to be replaced by new ones. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2005.
|: CCurve - Generates self-similar linear fractals, including the classic "C Curve". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levy_C_curve Written by Rick Campbell; 1999.

|: Circuit - Animates a number of 3D electronic components. Written by Ben Buxton; 2001.
|: CloudLife - Generates cloud-like formations based on a variant of Conway's Life. The difference is that cells have a maximum age, after which they count as 3 for populating the next generation. This makes long-lived formations explode instead of just sitting there. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life Written by Don Marti; 2003.
|: Compass - This draws a compass, with all elements spinning about randomly, for that "lost and nauseous" feeling. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.
|: Coral - Simulates coral growth, albeit somewhat slowly. Written by Frederick Roeber; 1997.

|: Cube21 - Animates a Rubik-like puzzle known as Cube 21 or Square-1. The rotations are chosen randomly. See also the "Rubik", "RubikBlocks" and "GLSnake" screen savers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_One_%28puzzle%29 Written by Vasek Potocek; 2005.
|: Cubenetic - Draws a pulsating set of overlapping boxes with ever-chaning blobby patterns undulating across their surfaces. It's sort of a cubist Lavalite. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2002.
|: CubeStorm - Draws a series of rotating 3D boxes that intersect each other and eventually fill space. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2003.
|: CubicGrid - Draws the view of an observer located inside a rotating 3D lattice of colored points. Written by Vasek Potocek; 2007.

|: Cynosure - Random dropshadowed rectangles pop onto the screen in lockstep. Written by Ozymandias G. Desiderata, Jamie Zawinski, and Stephen Linhart; 1998.
|: DangerBall - Draws a ball that periodically extrudes many random spikes. Ouch! Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2001.
|: DecayScreen - This takes an image and makes it melt. You've no doubt seen this effect before, but no screensaver would really be complete without it. It works best if there's something colorful visible. Warning, if the effect continues after the screen saver is off, seek medical attention. Written by David Wald, Vivek Khera, Jamie Zawinski, and Vince Levey; 1993.
|: Deco - Subdivides and colors rectangles randomly. It looks kind of like Brady-Bunch-era rec-room wall paneling. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian#Paris_1919.E2.80.931938 Written by Jamie Zawinski and Michael Bayne; 1997.
|: Deluxe - Draws a pulsing sequence of transparent stars, circles, and lines. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.

|: Drift - Drifting recursive fractal cosmic flames. Written by Scott Draves; 1997.
|: Endgame - Black slips out of three mating nets, but the fourth one holds him tight! A brilliant composition! See also the "Queens" screen saver. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame Written by Blair Tennessy; 2002.
|: Engine - Draws a simple model of an engine that floats around the screen. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine#Operation Written by Ben Buxton and Ed Beroset; 2001.
|: Epicycle - This draws the path traced out by a point on the edge of a circle. That circle rotates around a point on the rim of another circle, and so on, several times. These were the basis for the pre-heliocentric model of planetary motion. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle Written by James Youngman; 1998.
|: Eruption - Exploding fireworks. See also the "Fireworkx", "XFlame" and "Pyro" screen savers. Written by W.P. van Paassen; 2003.

As such, it's quite GPU-intensive: if you don't have a very good graphics card, it will hurt your machine bad. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2002.
|: GLCells - Cells growing, dividing and dying on your screen. Written by Matthias Toussaint; 2007.
|: Gleidescope - A kaleidoscope that operates on your desktop image, or on image files loaded from disk. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope Written by Andrew Dean; 2003.

|: Goop - This draws set of animating, transparent, amoeba-like blobs. The blobs change shape as they wander around the screen, and they are translucent, so you can see the lower blobs through the higher ones, and when one passes over another, their colors merge. I got the idea for this from a mouse pad I had once, which achieved the same kind of effect in real life by having several layers of plastic with colored oil between them. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.
|: Grav - This draws a simple orbital simulation. With trails enabled, it looks kind of like a cloud-chamber photograph. Written by Greg Bowering; 1997.

|: IMSMap - This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation. Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.
|: Interaggregate - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. Though actually it doesn't look like circles at all! Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski; 2004.
|: Interference - Color field based on computing decaying sinusoidal waves. Written by Hannu Mallat; 1998.
|: Intermomentary - A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some arbitrary size. Circles are drawn with small moving points along the perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs. Glowing orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the intersection point. Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski; 2004.
|: JigglyPuff - This does bad things with quasi-spherical objects. You have a tetrahedron with tesselated faces. The vertices on these faces have forces on them: one proportional to the distance from the surface of a sphere; and one proportional to the distance from the neighbors. They also have inertia. The resulting effect can range from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm. Somewhere in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles in a kind of disturbing manner. Written by Keith Macleod; 2003.

Please act accordingly. See also http://www.jwz.org/webcollage/ Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.
|: WhirlWindWarp - Floating stars are acted upon by a mixture of simple 2D forcefields. The strength of each forcefield changes continuously, and it is also switched on and off at random. Written by Paul 'Joey' Clark; 2001.
|: Wormhole - Flying through a colored wormhole in space. Written by Jon Rafkind; 2004.
|: XAnalogTV - XAnalogTV shows a detailed simulation of an old TV set showing various test patterns, with various picture artifacts like snow, bloom, distortion, ghosting, and hash noise. It also simulates the TV warming up. It will cycle through 12 channels, some with images you give it, and some with color bars or nothing but static. Written by Trevor Blackwell; 2003.
|: XFlame - Draws a simulation of pulsing fire. It can also take an arbitrary image and set it on fire too. Written by Carsten Haitzler and many others; 1999.
|: XJack - This behaves schizophrenically and makes a lot of typos. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.
|: XLyap - This generates pretty fractal pictures via the Lyapunov exponent. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent Written by Ron Record; 1997.
|: XMatrix - Draws dropping characters similar to what is seen on the computer monitors in "The Matrix". See also "GLMatrix" for a 3D rendering of the similar effect that appeared in the movie's title sequence. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.
|: XRaySwarm - Draws a few swarms of critters flying around the screen, with faded color trails behind them. Written by Chris Leger; 2000.
|: XSpirograph - Simulates that pen-in-nested-plastic-gears toy from your childhood. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph Written by Rohit Singh; 2000.
|: Zoom - Zooms in on a part of the screen and then moves around. With the "Lenses" option, the result is like looking through many overlapping lenses rather than just a simple zoom. Written by James Macnicol; 2001.
