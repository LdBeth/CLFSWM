NAME
----
clfswm - A(nother) Common Lisp Full Screen Window Manager


SYNOPSIS
--------
*clfswm* ['implementation']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
CLFSWM is a 100% Common Lisp X11 window manager (based on Tinywm and
Stumpwm. Many thanks to them).  It can be driven only with the
keyboard or with the mouse.

CLFSWM uses the following rules to determine which implementation
should be used:

. the first command line argument.
. environment variable $LISP
. the first line like "debian=<impl>" in its configuration file.
. clisp

CLFSWM handles clisp, sbcl and cmucl internally.  If you specify a
different implementation, CLFSWM will try to execute the command
`clfswm-<implementation>`.  See /usr/share/doc/clfswm/README.Debian
for details.


OPTIONS
-------
'implementation'::
	Indicates which implementation should be used.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------
'LISP'::
	Indicates which implementation should be used.


FILES

	User configuration file.  If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is undefined,
	'$HOME/.config/clfswm/clfswmrc' will be used.

'$HOME/.clfswmrc'::
	Deprecated.  This file will be used only if the previous file
	does not exist.

'/etc/clfswmrc'::
	System-wide configuration file.
