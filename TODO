URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.

- Make alias for :mod-1 -> :alt   :mod-2 -> :numlock

- Show config -> list and display documentation for all tweakable global variables. [Philippe]
   TODO :
   In ~/.clfswmrc:
      ;;;; AUTO-CONFIG - Do not edit those lines by hands: they are overwritten by CLFSWM
      (defparameter *ma-var* value)
      ...
      ;;;; AUTO-CONFIG End : You can add your configurations below this line.

- Support clisp/new-clx and prevent to crash clisp with this CLX version.

- Mouse support in menu

- Remote access to the clfswm REPL [Philippe]
   this can be done with net.lisp or via xprop (ie the Stumpwm way).


MAYBE
=====

- cd/pwd a la shell to navigate through frames. [Philippe]

- Zoom

Concept:
  * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
  * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%. The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

Operation:
  * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
  * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
    * left
    * right
    * up
    * down

- Undo/redo (any idea to implement this is welcome)
