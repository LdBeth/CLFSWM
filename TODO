URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.

- Make CLFSWM running with ECL


FOR THE NEXT RELEASE
====================

- Add toolbar modules in contrib/toolbar.lisp. Any help or request on adding the modules
  you want in your toolbar is very welcome.


MAYBE
=====

- Implement a save/restore root-frame system. And use it on error reset or for undo/redo.

- Add a tabbar layout : save some space on top/left... of the frame and display clickable
    children name.

- cd/pwd/find a la shell to navigate through frames.

- Zoom:
    Concept:
      * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but
        completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
      * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%.
        The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

    Operation:
      * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
      * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
        * left
        * right
        * up
        * down

    Note: This is done by some applications like the surf web browser from suckless:
      http://surf.suckless.org/

    Maybe this can be done with a compositing system:

- Undo/redo
