URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.

- Use xdg menu spec instead of the Debian specific update-menu command.

- Add a data slot to tell if a frame must hide or not its floating windows when its not selected.


MAYBE
=====

- cd/pwd a la shell to navigate through frames.

- Zoom

Concept:
  * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
  * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%. The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

Operation:
  * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
  * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
    * left
    * right
    * up
    * down

- Undo/redo
