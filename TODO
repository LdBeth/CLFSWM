URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.

Rewrote all useful code present in 0801 version.
- pack/fill/resize [Philippe]
- mouse operations [Philippe]
- Bind alt+1/2/3/4... to a particular child:
   If bind exist -> focus this child
   If not -> bind the key to the current-child
  Bind alt+control+1/2/3/4... to remove binding on a child.


- Hooks when a new window is mapped [Philippe]
- Show group window for info (Wait for keypress or an amount of time) [Philippe]


MAYBE
=====

- From stumpwm: [Philippe]
 "In other news stumpwm should catch unhandled errors, restart, and
 print an error message. And there is now a soft-restart command. With
 this in place I suspect you will need to restart stumpwm very rarely
 and it won't spontaneously bring down X."


NEVER
=====

Nothing here for now.
