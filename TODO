URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.

-> Nothing here yet.


FOR THE NEXT RELEASE
====================

- Implement a save/restore root-frame system. ANd use it on error reset.

MAYBE
=====

- cd/pwd/find a la shell to navigate through frames.

- Zoom:
    Concept:
      * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but
        completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
      * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%.
        The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

    Operation:
      * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
      * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
        * left
        * right
        * up
        * down

    Note: This is done by some applications like the surf web browser from suckless:

    Maybe this can be done with a compositing system:

- Undo/redo
