This file contains suggestions for further work.
Feel free to edit the wiki at http://trac.common-lisp.net/clfswm/wiki
if you want something in clfswm.


URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.

- Move the autodoc in its own file (clfswm-autodoc.lisp) and make the autodoc
  for the menu system.


LESS URGENT TODO
================

- Hook to open next window in named/numbered frame [Philippe]

- Ensure-unique-number/name (new function) [Philippe]

- Raise/lower frame - this can be done with children order [Philippe]

- Show config -> list and display documentation for all tweakable global variables. [Philippe]

- A Gimp layout example [Philippe]

- Add boundaries in the info window [Philippe]


MAYBE
=====

- From stumpwm: [Philippe]
 "In other news stumpwm should catch unhandled errors, restart, and
 print an error message. And there is now a soft-restart command. With
 this in place I suspect you will need to restart stumpwm very rarely
 and it won't spontaneously bring down X."

- Zoom

Concept:
  * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
  * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%. The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

Operation:
  * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
  * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
    * left
    * right
    * up
    * down

- Remote access to the clfswm REPL [Philippe]

- cd/pwd a la shell to navigate throu frames. [Philippe] 

- Hide/Unhide frame [Philippe]

- Undo/redo (any idea to implement this is welcome)

- Double buffering for all text windows.
