URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.

Rewrote all useful code present in 0801 version.
- mouse operations [Philippe]
- Hide a window when its size is less than hint minimal size. [Philippe]
- Bind alt+1/2/3/4... to a particular child: [Philippe]
   If bind exist -> focus this child
   If not -> bind the key to the current-child
  Bind alt+control+1/2/3/4... to remove binding on a child.

- Hook to open next window in named/numbered frame [Philippe]

- Undo/redo (any idea to implement this is welcome)

- Ensure-unique-number/name (new function) [Philippe]

- Float->Screen Screen->Float: convert geometry from 0 to 1 to pixel and from pixel to 0 to 1. [Philippe]

- Raise/lower frame [Philippe]

- Hide/Unhide frame [Philippe]

- Add boundaries in the info window [Philippe]

- get-frame-by-name (path)  [Philippe]
  get-frame-by-name (path): return the frame that its own frame has this name if it exists such a frame
  get-window-by-name (path): return the window that its own frame that its own frame has this name if it exists such a window.

- A better algorithm to display all children (ie: raise just needed children and with less filckering)


MAYBE
=====

- From stumpwm: [Philippe]
 "In other news stumpwm should catch unhandled errors, restart, and
 print an error message. And there is now a soft-restart command. With
 this in place I suspect you will need to restart stumpwm very rarely
 and it won't spontaneously bring down X."

- Zoom

Concept:
  * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
  * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%. The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

Operation:
  * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
  * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
    * left
    * right
    * up
    * down

- Remote access to the clfswm REPL [Philippe]

- cd/pwd a la shell to navigate throu frames. [Philippe] 


NEVER
=====

Nothing here for now.
