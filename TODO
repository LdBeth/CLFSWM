URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.

- Make alias for :mod-1 -> :alt   :mod-2 -> :numlock

- hook to create bindings and menu -> build keys and menu at runtime.

- Show config -> list and display documentation for all tweakable global variables. [Philippe]
   TODO :
   In ~/.clfswmrc:
      ;;;; AUTO-CONFIG - Do not edit those lines by hands: they are overwritten by CLFSWM
      (defparameter *ma-var* value)
      ...
      ;;;; AUTO-CONFIG End : You can add your configurations below this line.

- Remote access to the clfswm REPL [Philippe]
   Protocol:  Server: Ask: random-number
              Client: Reply: associated random-number
              Server: Ok
              Client: a lisp form (+ 2 2)
              ...
   Random-number at compile time: '((rnd-1-server rnd-1-client) (rnd-1-server rnd-1-client) (rnd-1-server rnd-1-client) ...)

- Support clisp/new-clx and prevent to crash clisp with this CLX version.


MAYBE
=====

- cd/pwd a la shell to navigate throw frames. [Philippe]

- Zoom

Concept:
  * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
  * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%. The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

Operation:
  * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
  * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
    * left
    * right
    * up
    * down

- Undo/redo (any idea to implement this is welcome)

- Mouse support in menu?
