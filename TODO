URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.


FOR THE NEXT RELEASE
====================

- Make frame/window border size variable.

- Make a green border for the window to move and remove the
  focus-all-children/show-all-children.

- In show-all-children: add the ability to display all child from
  *root-frame* and hide all those who are not in *current-root*.
  -> remove hide-all-children when needed.

- in show-all-children: simplify the selected -> remove the parent one.

- estimate the time to raise/lower a child in show-all-children and
  see if there is a need for a rectangular optimization

- Change the config system with a more lispy one and a less string
  base one: (defconfig name group doc)


MAYBE
=====

- cd/pwd a la shell to navigate through frames.

- Zoom:
    Concept:
      * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but
        completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
      * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%.
        The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

    Operation:
      * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
      * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
        * left
        * right
        * up
        * down

    Maybe this can be done with a compositing system:

- Undo/redo
