URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.

- Bind control+g to escape all actions like emacs.

- Remote access to the clfswm REPL [Philippe]
   this can be done with net.lisp or via xprop (ie the Stumpwm way).
   Protocol:
     - start-server => create a new file /tmp/clfswm-server-port with right (rw-------)
         and place a key which change on each connection.
     - client must read this file and send the key before using the command line.
     - server change its key when the connection is done.
     - add a minimal cript in the protocol (for example a rotN) with N coded in the key.



MAYBE
=====

- cd/pwd a la shell to navigate through frames. [Philippe]

- Zoom

Concept:
  * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
  * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%. The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

Operation:
  * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
  * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
    * left
    * right
    * up
    * down

- Undo/redo (any idea to implement this is welcome)
