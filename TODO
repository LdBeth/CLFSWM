URGENT PROBLEMS
===============
Should handle these soon.


FOR THE NEXT RELEASE
====================

- Make frame/window border size variable.

- Estimate the time to raise/lower a child in show-all-children and
  see if there is a need for a rectangular optimization:
  Result: map-window: 1.2E-5 sec.  change stack order: 3.14E-4 sec.
  => It maybe useful to optimize this part.
  + Do not redisplay a child already displayed
  Implementation note: build a list with all displayed children and there sizes
    -> display a child only if it is not already displayed and it's not behind
    a child already displayed (-> search in child list and return as soon as one is found)


MAYBE
=====

- cd/pwd a la shell to navigate through frames.

- Zoom:
    Concept:
      * zoom out: Behave as if the application window is bigger for the application but
        completely drawn in a small amount of space (miniature). The zoom factor is inferior to 100%
      * zoom in: Behave as a magnifying glass. The zoom factor is superior to 100%.
        The part of the application window shown (viewport) can be moved.

    Operation:
      * set-zoom-factor (frame, factor)
      * move-viewport (frame &optional (increment 1))
        * left
        * right
        * up
        * down

    Maybe this can be done with a compositing system:

- Undo/redo
