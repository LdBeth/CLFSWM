The contrib directory is here if you want to contribute to CLFSWM and
if your code is not merged in the clfswm core.

To contribute, place your files in the contrib directory.
You can have your own repository and tell me if you want to merge it
in the clfswm svn/git.

To use a contributed code add a line like this in your configuration
file:

(load-contrib "contrib-example.lisp")

Have fun,

Philippe
