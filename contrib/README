This directory is here if you want to contribute to CLFSWM and if your
code is not merged in the clfswm core.

How can you contribute:

  - If your code is in one file, just tell use how to load it and how
    to configure it from the clfswm configuration file.
 
  - If your code takes more than one file, make a new directory and
    create a new asd file in the contrib directory to load it from the
    configuration file.

(Some examples will come here. [Philippe])
